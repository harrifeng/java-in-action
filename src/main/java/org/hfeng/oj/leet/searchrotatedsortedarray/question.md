Search in Rotated Sorted Array
----------
+ Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand
  >[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
+ You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index,
  otherwise return -1
+ You may assume no duplicate exists in the array
